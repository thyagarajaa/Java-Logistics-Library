# ***Dijkstra's Algorithm Tools***

## 1. Basic Functions:
- `Node` represents a vertex in an undirected graph.
- `Graph` represents a collection of nodes.
- Uses the [Baeldung Implementation](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dijkstra) of Djikstra's Algorithm
- Allows import of a Node/Distance matrix from a CSV file and runs Djikstra'a algorithm
- Utilizes Mapbox Matrix API to create distance matrix for real world points and runs Djikstra's Algorithm

## 2. Using the CSV Import Tool
